# #Question 1. Write a python program to add two numbers.
# a=23
# b=33
# print(a+b)
# # Question 2. Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.
# a=34
# b=5
# print("Remainder when a is ivided by b is",a%b)

# # Question 3) check the type of variable assigned using input () function.
# a=input("Enter the value of a:")
# print(type(a))

# #Question 4.Use comparision operater to find out wether a given variable a is greater than b or not . take a=34 and b=80

# a=int(input("Enter the first number :"))
# b=int(input("Enter the second number"))
# print("a is Greater than b is ",a>b)

# # Question 5.) write a python program to find the average of a number entered by a user
# a=int(input("Enter the first number :"))
# b=int(input("Enter the Second number :"))
# print ("Average of these two numbers is",(a+b)/2)

#Question 6)Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user

a=int(input("Enter the your number :"))
print ("Square of the  numbers is",a**2)
# print ("Square of the  numbers is",a^2) this is Incorrect in Python
